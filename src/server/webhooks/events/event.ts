/**
 * When you have a webhook with an event, Bitbucket Data Center sends the event
 * request to the server URL for the webhook whenever that event occurs.
 *
 * For Bitbucket to send event payload requests for a webhook with HTTPS
 * endpoints, make sure your URL has a valid SSL certificate that a public
 * certificate authority has signed.
 *
 * The following payloads contain some of the common entity types: `User`,
 * `Repository`, `Comment`, and `Pull Request` â€“ which have consistent
 * representations in all the payloads where they appear. For example, the actor
 * property in the `repo:refs_changed` payload is a representation of the
 * event's user.
