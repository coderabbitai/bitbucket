		 * Update an installed app
		 * @description Updates the application installation for the user.
		 *
		 *     This endpoint is intended to be used by Bitbucket Connect apps
		 *     and only supports JWT authentication -- that is how Bitbucket
		 *     identifies the particular installation of the app. Developers
		 *     with applications registered in the "Develop Apps" section
		 *     of Bitbucket need not use this endpoint as updates for those
		 *     applications can be sent out via the UI of that section.
		 *
		 *     Passing an empty body will update the installation using the
		 *     existing descriptor URL.
		 *
		 *     ```
		 *     $ curl -X PUT https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/addon \
		 *       -H "Authorization: JWT <JWT Token>" \
		 *       --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
		 *       --data '{}'
		 *     ```
		 *
		 *     The new `descriptor` for the installation can be also provided
		 *     in the body directly.
		 *
		 *     ```
		 *     $ curl -X PUT https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/addon \
		 *       -H "Authorization: JWT <JWT Token>" \
		 *       --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
		 *       --data '{"descriptor": $NEW_DESCRIPTOR}'
		 *     ```
		 *
		 *     In both these modes the URL of the descriptor cannot be changed. To
		 *     change the descriptor location and upgrade an installation
		 *     the request must be made exclusively with a `descriptor_url`.
		 *
		 *      ```
		 *     $ curl -X PUT https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/addon \
		 *       -H "Authorization: JWT <JWT Token>" \
		 *       --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
		 *       --data '{"descriptor_url": $NEW_URL}'
		 *     ```
		 *
		 *     The `descriptor_url` must exactly match the marketplace registration
		 *     that Atlassian has for the application. Contact your Atlassian
		 *     developer advocate to update this registration. Once the registration
		 *     has been updated you may call this resource for each installation.
		 *
		 *     Note that the scopes of the application cannot be increased
		 *     in the new descriptor nor reduced to none.

		 * Create a branch restriction rule
		 * @description Creates a new branch restriction rule for a repository.
		 *
		 *     `kind` describes what will be restricted. Allowed values include:
		 *     `push`, `force`, `delete`, `restrict_merges`, `require_tasks_to_be_completed`,
		 *     `require_approvals_to_merge`, `require_default_reviewer_approvals_to_merge`,
		 *     `require_no_changes_requested`, `require_passing_builds_to_merge`, `require_commits_behind`,
		 *     `reset_pullrequest_approvals_on_change`, `smart_reset_pullrequest_approvals`,
		 *     `reset_pullrequest_changes_requested_on_change`, `require_all_dependencies_merged`,
		 *     `enforce_merge_checks`, and `allow_auto_merge_when_builds_pass`.
		 *
		 *     Different kinds of branch restrictions have different requirements:
		 *
		 *     * `push` and `restrict_merges` require `users` and `groups` to be
		 *       specified. Empty lists are allowed, in which case permission is
		 *       denied for everybody.
		 *
		 *     The restriction applies to all branches that match. There are
		 *     two ways to match a branch. It is configured in `branch_match_kind`:
		 *
		 *     1. `glob`: Matches a branch against the `pattern`. A `'*'` in
		 *        `pattern` will expand to match zero or more characters, and every
		 *        other character matches itself. For example, `'foo*'` will match
		 *        `'foo'` and `'foobar'`, but not `'barfoo'`. `'*'` will match all
		 *        branches.
		 *     2. `branching_model`: Matches a branch against the repository's
		 *        branching model. The `branch_type` controls the type of branch
		 *        to match. Allowed values include: `production`, `development`,
		 *        `bugfix`, `release`, `feature` and `hotfix`.
		 *
		 *     The combination of `kind` and match must be unique. This means that
		 *     two `glob` restrictions in a repository cannot have the same `kind` and
		 *     `pattern`. Additionally, two `branching_model` restrictions in a
		 *     repository cannot have the same `kind` and `branch_type`.
		 *
		 *     `users` and `groups` are lists of users and groups that are except from
		 *     the restriction. They can only be configured in `push` and
		 *     `restrict_merges` restrictions. The `push` restriction stops a user
		 *     pushing to matching branches unless that user is in `users` or is a
		 *     member of a group in `groups`. The `restrict_merges` stops a user
		 *     merging pull requests to matching branches unless that user is in
		 *     `users` or is a member of a group in `groups`. Adding new users or
		 *     groups to an existing restriction should be done via `PUT`.
		 *
		 *     Note that branch restrictions with overlapping matchers is allowed,
		 *     but the resulting behavior may be surprising.

		 *     The `development` branch can be configured to a specific branch or to
		 *     track the main branch. When set to a specific branch it must
		 *     currently exist. Only the passed properties will be updated. The
		 *     properties not passed will be left unchanged. A request without a
		 *     `development` property will leave the development branch unchanged.
		 *
		 *     It is possible for the `development` branch to be invalid. This
		 *     happens when it points at a specific branch that has been
		 *     deleted. This is indicated in the `is_valid` field for the branch. It is
		 *     not possible to update the settings for `development` if that
		 *     would leave the branch in an invalid state. Such a request will be
		 *     rejected.
		 *
		 *     The `production` branch can be a specific branch, the main
		 *     branch or disabled. When set to a specific branch it must currently
		 *     exist. The `enabled` property can be used to enable (`true`) or
		 *     disable (`false`) it. Only the passed properties will be updated. The
		 *     properties not passed will be left unchanged. A request without a
		 *     `production` property will leave the production branch unchanged.
		 *
		 *     It is possible for the `production` branch to be invalid. This
		 *     happens when it points at a specific branch that has been
		 *     deleted. This is indicated in the `is_valid` field for the branch. A
		 *     request that would leave `production` enabled and invalid will be
		 *     rejected. It is possible to update `production` and make it invalid if
		 *     it would also be left disabled.
		 *
		 *     The `branch_types` property contains the branch types to be updated.
		 *     Only the branch types passed will be updated. All updates will be
		 *     rejected if it would leave the branching model in an invalid state.
		 *     For branch types this means that:
		 *
		 *     1. The prefixes for all enabled branch types are valid. For example,
		 *        it is not possible to use '*' inside a Git prefix.
		 *     2. A prefix of an enabled branch type must not be a prefix of another
		 *        enabled branch type. This is to ensure that a branch can be easily
		 *        classified by its prefix unambiguously.
		 *
		 *     It is possible to store an invalid prefix if that branch type would be
		 *     left disabled. Only the passed properties will be updated. The
		 *     properties not passed will be left unchanged. Each branch type must
		 *     have a `kind` property to identify it.
		 *
		 *     There is currently a side effect when using this API endpoint. If the
		 *     repository is inheriting branching model settings from its project,
		 *     updating the branching model for this repository will disable the
		 *     project setting inheritance.
		 *
		 *
		 *     We have deprecated this side effect and will remove it on 1 August 2022.

		 *     The context variables available are `repository` and `commit`.
		 *
		 *     To associate a commit status to a pull request, the refname field must be set to the source branch

		 *
		 *     Returns all commits on ref `dev` or `foo`, except those that are reachable on
		 *     `master` (similar to `git log dev foo ^master`).
		 *
		 *     An optional `path` parameter can be specified that will limit the
		 *     results to commits that affect that path. `path` can either be a file
		 *     or a directory. If a directory is specified, commits are returned that
		 *     have modified any file in the directory tree rooted by `path`. It is
		 *     important to note that if the `path` parameter is specified, the commits
		 *     returned by this endpoint may no longer be a DAG, parent commits that
		 *     do not modify the path will be omitted from the response.
		 *
		 *     #### GET /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/commits/dev?path=README.md&include=foo&include=bar&exclude=master
		 *
		 *     Returns all commits that are on refs `dev` or `foo` or `bar`, but not on `master`
		 *     that changed the file README.md.
		 *
		 *     #### GET /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/commits/dev?path=src/&include=foo&exclude=master
		 *
		 *     Returns all commits that are on refs `dev` or `foo`, but not on `master`
		 *     that changed to a file in any file in the directory src or its children.
		 *
		 *     Because the response could include a very large number of commits, it
		 *     is paginated. Follow the 'next' link in the response to navigate to the
		 *     next page of commits. As with other paginated resources, do not
		 *     construct your own links.
		 *
		 *     When the include and exclude parameters are more than can fit in a
		 *     query string, clients can use a `x-www-form-urlencoded` POST instead.

		/**
		 * Fork a repository
		 * @description Creates a new fork of the specified repository.
		 *
		 *     #### Forking a repository
		 *
		 *     To create a fork, specify the workspace explicitly as part of the
		 *     request body:
		 *
		 *     ```
		 *     $ curl -X POST -u jdoe https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/forks \
		 *       -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
		 *         "name": "bbql_fork",
		 *         "workspace": {
		 *           "slug": "atlassian"
		 *         }
		 *     }'
		 *     ```
		 *
		 *     To fork a repository into the same workspace, also specify a new `name`.
		 *
		 *     When you specify a value for `name`, it will also affect the `slug`.
		 *     The `slug` is reflected in the repository URL of the new fork. It is
		 *     derived from `name` by substituting non-ASCII characters, removes
		 *     whitespace, and changes characters to lower case. For example,
		 *     `My repo` would turn into `my_repo`.
		 *
		 *     You need contributor access to create new forks within a workspace.
		 *
		 *
		 *     #### Change the properties of a new fork
		 *
		 *     By default the fork inherits most of its properties from the parent.
		 *     However, since the optional POST body document follows the normal
		 *     `repository` JSON schema and you can override the new fork's
		 *     properties.
		 *
		 *     Properties that can be overridden include:
		 *
		 *     * description
		 *     * fork_policy
		 *     * language
		 *     * mainbranch
		 *     * is_private (note that a private repo's fork_policy might prohibit
		 *       the creation of public forks, in which `is_private=False` would fail)
		 *     * has_issues (to initialize or disable the new repo's issue tracker --
		 *       note that the actual contents of the parent repository's issue
		 *       tracker are not copied during forking)
		 *     * has_wiki (to initialize or disable the new repo's wiki --
		 *       note that the actual contents of the parent repository's wiki are not
		 *       copied during forking)
		 *     * project (when forking into a private project, the fork's `is_private`
		 *       must be `true`)
		 *
		 *     Properties that cannot be modified include:
		 *
		 *     * scm
		 *     * parent

		 *
		 *     ```
		 *     curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/site/master/issues/1234/changes \

		 *           "assignee_account_id": {
		 *             "new": "557058:c0b72ad0-1cb5-4018-9cdc-0cde8492c443"
		 *           },

		 *
		 *     The above example also includes a custom comment to go alongside the
		 *     change. This comment will also be visible on the issue page in the UI.
		 *
		 *     The fields of the `changes` object are strings, not objects. This
		 *     allows for immutable change log records, even after user accounts,
		 *     milestones, or other objects recorded in a change entry, get renamed or
		 *     deleted.
		 *
		 *     The `assignee_account_id` field stores the account id. When POSTing a
		 *     new change and changing the assignee, the client should therefore use
		 *     the user's account_id in the `changes.assignee_account_id.new` field.
		 *
		 *     This call requires authentication. Private repositories or private
		 *     issue trackers require the caller to authenticate with an account that

		 * Run a pipeline
		 * @description Endpoint to create and initiate a pipeline.
		 *     There are a couple of different options to initiate a pipeline, where the payload of the request will determine which type of pipeline will be instantiated.
		 *     # Trigger a Pipeline for a branch
		 *     One way to trigger pipelines is by specifying the branch for which you want to trigger a pipeline.
		 *     The specified branch will be used to determine which pipeline definition from the `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file will be applied to initiate the pipeline. The pipeline will then do a clone of the repository and checkout the latest revision of the specified branch.
		 *
		 *     ### Example
		 *
		 *     ```
		 *     $ curl -X POST -is -u username:password \
		 *       -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
		 *      https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/jeroendr/meat-demo2/pipelines/ \
		 *       -d '
		 *       {
		 *         "target": {

		 *           "type": "pipeline_ref_target",
		 *           "ref_name": "master"
		 *         }
		 *       }'
		 *     ```
		 *     # Trigger a Pipeline for a commit on a branch or tag
		 *     You can initiate a pipeline for a specific commit and in the context of a specified reference (e.g. a branch, tag or bookmark).
		 *     The specified reference will be used to determine which pipeline definition from the bitbucket-pipelines.yml file will be applied to initiate the pipeline. The pipeline will clone the repository and then do a checkout the specified reference.
		 *
		 *     The following reference types are supported:
		 *
		 *     * `branch`
		 *     * `named_branch`
		 *     * `bookmark`
		 *      * `tag`
		 *
		 *     ### Example
		 *
		 *     ```
		 *     $ curl -X POST -is -u username:password \
		 *       -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
		 *       https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/jeroendr/meat-demo2/pipelines/ \

		 *           "commit": {
		 *             "type": "commit",
		 *             "hash": "ce5b7431602f7cbba007062eeb55225c6e18e956"
		 *           },
		 *           "ref_type": "branch",
		 *           "type": "pipeline_ref_target",
		 *           "ref_name": "master"
		 *         }
		 *       }'
		 *     ```
		 *     # Trigger a specific pipeline definition for a commit
		 *     You can trigger a specific pipeline that is defined in your `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file for a specific commit.
		 *     In addition to the commit revision, you specify the type and pattern of the selector that identifies the pipeline definition. The resulting pipeline will then clone the repository and checkout the specified revision.
		 *
		 *     ### Example
		 *
		 *     ```
		 *     $ curl -X POST -is -u username:password \
		 *       -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
		 *      https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/jeroendr/meat-demo2/pipelines/ \

		 *             "type":"pipeline_commit_target"
		 *        }
		 *       }'

		 *     # Trigger a specific pipeline definition for a commit on a branch or tag
		 *     You can trigger a specific pipeline that is defined in your `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file for a specific commit in the context of a specified reference.
		 *     In addition to the commit revision, you specify the type and pattern of the selector that identifies the pipeline definition, as well as the reference information. The resulting pipeline will then clone the repository a checkout the specified reference.

		 *       }'
		 *     ```
		 *
		 *     # Trigger a pull request pipeline
		 *
		 *     You can also initiate a pipeline for a specific pull request.
		 *
		 *     ### Example
		 *
		 *     ```

		/**
		 * Create a commit by uploading a file
		 * @description This endpoint is used to create new commits in the repository by
		 *     uploading files.
		 *
		 *     To add a new file to a repository:
		 *
		 *     ```
		 *     $ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/username/slug/src \
		 *       -F /repo/path/to/image.png=@image.png
		 *     ```
		 *
		 *     This will create a new commit on top of the main branch, inheriting the
		 *     contents of the main branch, but adding (or overwriting) the
		 *     `image.png` file to the repository in the `/repo/path/to` directory.
		 *
		 *     To create a commit that deletes files, use the `files` parameter:
		 *
		 *     ```
		 *     $ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/username/slug/src \
		 *       -F files=/file/to/delete/1.txt \
		 *       -F files=/file/to/delete/2.txt
		 *     ```
		 *
		 *     You can add/modify/delete multiple files in a request. Rename/move a
		 *     file by deleting the old path and adding the content at the new path.
		 *
		 *     This endpoint accepts `multipart/form-data` (as in the examples above),
		 *     as well as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.
		 *
		 *     Note: `multipart/form-data` is currently not supported by Forge apps
		 *     for this API.
		 *
		 *     #### multipart/form-data
		 *
		 *     A `multipart/form-data` post contains a series of "form fields" that
		 *     identify both the individual files that are being uploaded, as well as
		 *     additional, optional meta data.
		 *
		 *     Files are uploaded in file form fields (those that have a
		 *     `Content-Disposition` parameter) whose field names point to the remote
		 *     path in the repository where the file should be stored. Path field
		 *     names are always interpreted to be absolute from the root of the
		 *     repository, regardless whether the client uses a leading slash (as the
		 *     above `curl` example did).
		 *
		 *     File contents are treated as bytes and are not decoded as text.
		 *
		 *     The commit message, as well as other non-file meta data for the
		 *     request, is sent along as normal form field elements. Meta data fields
		 *     share the same namespace as the file objects. For `multipart/form-data`
		 *     bodies that should not lead to any ambiguity, as the
		 *     `Content-Disposition` header will contain the `filename` parameter to
		 *     distinguish between a file named "message" and the commit message field.
		 *
		 *     #### application/x-www-form-urlencoded
		 *
		 *     It is also possible to upload new files using a simple
		 *     `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` POST. This can be convenient when
		 *     uploading pure text files:
		 *
		 *     ```
		 *     $ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src \
		 *       --data-urlencode "/path/to/me.txt=Lorem ipsum." \
		 *       --data-urlencode "message=Initial commit" \
		 *       --data-urlencode "author=Erik van Zijst <erik.van.zijst@gmail.com>"
		 *     ```
		 *
		 *     There could be a field name clash if a client were to upload a file
		 *     named "message", as this filename clashes with the meta data property
		 *     for the commit message. To avoid this and to upload files whose names
		 *     clash with the meta data properties, use a leading slash for the files,
		 *     e.g. `curl --data-urlencode "/message=file contents"`.
		 *
		 *     When an explicit slash is omitted for a file whose path matches that of
		 *     a meta data parameter, then it is interpreted as meta data, not as a
		 *     file.
		 *
		 *     #### Executables and links
		 *
		 *     While this API aims to facilitate the most common use cases, it is
		 *     possible to perform some more advanced operations like creating a new
		 *     symlink in the repository, or creating an executable file.
		 *
		 *     Files can be supplied with a `x-attributes` value in the
		 *     `Content-Disposition` header. For example, to upload an executable
		 *     file, as well as create a symlink from `README.txt` to `README`:
		 *
		 *     ```
		 *     --===============1438169132528273974==
		 *     Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
		 *     MIME-Version: 1.0
		 *     Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
		 *     Content-ID: "bin/shutdown.sh"
		 *     Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="shutdown.sh"; x-attributes:"executable"
		 *
		 *     #!/bin/sh
		 *     halt
		 *
		 *     --===============1438169132528273974==
		 *     Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
		 *     MIME-Version: 1.0
		 *     Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
		 *     Content-ID: "/README.txt"
		 *     Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="README.txt"; x-attributes:"link"
		 *
		 *     README
		 *     --===============1438169132528273974==--
		 *     ```
		 *
		 *     Links are files that contain the target path and have
		 *     `x-attributes:"link"` set.
		 *
		 *     When overwriting links with files, or vice versa, the newly uploaded
		 *     file determines both the new contents, as well as the attributes. That
		 *     means uploading a file without specifying `x-attributes="link"` will
		 *     create a regular file, even if the parent commit hosted a symlink at
		 *     the same path.
		 *
		 *     The same applies to executables. When modifying an existing executable
		 *     file, the form-data file element must include
		 *     `x-attributes="executable"` in order to preserve the executable status
		 *     of the file.
		 *
		 *     Note that this API does not support the creation or manipulation of
		 *     subrepos / submodules.

		 *     When `path` points to a file, this endpoint returns the raw contents.
		 *     The response's Content-Type is derived from the filename
		 *     extension (not from the contents). The file contents are not processed
		 *     and no character encoding/recoding is performed and as a result no
		 *     character encoding is included as part of the Content-Type.
		 *
		 *     The `Content-Disposition` header will be "attachment" to prevent
		 *     browsers from running executable files.
		 *
		 *     If the file is managed by LFS, then a 301 redirect pointing to
		 *     Atlassian's media services platform is returned.
		 *
		 *     The response includes an ETag that is based on the contents of the file
		 *     and its attributes. This means that an empty `__init__.py` always
		 *     returns the same ETag, regardless on the directory it lives in, or the
		 *     commit it is on.
		 *
		 *     #### File meta data
		 *
		 *     When the request for a file path includes the query parameter
		 *     `?format=meta`, instead of returning the file's raw contents, Bitbucket
		 *     instead returns the JSON object describing the file's properties:
		 *
		 *     ```javascript
		 *     $ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef/tests/__init__.py?format=meta
		 *     {
		 *       "links": {
		 *         "self": {
		 *           "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/__init__.py"

		 *         }
		 *       },
		 *       "path": "tests/__init__.py",
		 *       "commit": {
		 *         "type": "commit",
		 *         "hash": "eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335",
		 *         "links": {
		 *           "self": {
		 *             "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/commit/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335"
		 *           },
		 *           "html": {
		 *             "href": "https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/bbql/commits/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335"
		 *           }
		 *         }
		 *       },
		 *       "attributes": [],
		 *       "type": "commit_file",
		 *       "size": 0
		 *     }
		 *     ```
		 *
		 *     File objects contain an `attributes` element that contains a list of
		 *     possible modifiers. Currently defined values are:
		 *
		 *     * `link` -- indicates that the entry is a symbolic link. The contents
		 *         of the file represent the path the link points to.
		 *     * `executable` -- indicates that the file has the executable bit set.
		 *     * `subrepository` -- indicates that the entry points to a submodule or
		 *         subrepo. The contents of the file is the SHA1 of the repository
		 *         pointed to.
		 *     * `binary` -- indicates whether Bitbucket thinks the file is binary.
		 *
		 *     This endpoint can provide an alternative to how a HEAD request can be
		 *     used to check for the existence of a file, or a file's size without
		 *     incurring the overhead of receiving its full contents.
		 *
		 *
		 *     #### Directory listings
		 *
		 *     When `path` points to a directory instead of a file, the response is a
		 *     paginated list of directory and file objects in the same order as the
		 *     underlying SCM system would return them.
		 *
		 *     For example:
		 *
		 *     ```javascript
		 *     $ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef/tests
		 *     {
		 *       "pagelen": 10,
		 *       "values": [
		 *         {

		 *               },

		 *               }

		 *           },
		 *           "attributes": [],
		 *           "type": "commit_file",
		 *           "size": 0
		 *         }
		 *       ],
		 *       "page": 1,
		 *       "size": 2
		 *     }
		 *     ```
		 *
		 *     When listing the contents of the repo's root directory, the use of a
		 *     trailing slash at the end of the URL is required.
		 *
		 *     The response by default is not recursive, meaning that only the direct contents of
		 *     a path are returned. The response does not recurse down into
		 *     subdirectories. In order to "walk" the entire directory tree, the
		 *     client can either parse each response and follow the `self` links of each
		 *     `commit_directory` object, or can specify a `max_depth` to recurse to.
		 *
		 *     The max_depth parameter will do a breadth-first search to return the contents of the subdirectories
		 *     up to the depth specified. Breadth-first search was chosen as it leads to the least amount of
		 *     file system operations for git. If the `max_depth` parameter is specified to be too
		 *     large, the call will time out and return a 555.
		 *
		 *     Each returned object is either a `commit_file`, or a `commit_directory`,
		 *     both of which contain a `path` element. This path is the absolute path
		 *     from the root of the repository. Each object also contains a `commit`
		 *     object which embeds the commit the file is on. Note that this is merely
		 *     the commit that was used in the URL. It is *not* the commit that last
		 *     modified the file.
		 *
		 *     Directory objects have 2 representations. Their `self` link returns the
		 *     paginated contents of the directory. The `meta` link on the other hand
		 *     returns the actual `directory` object itself, e.g.:
		 *
		 *     ```javascript
		 *     {
		 *       "path": "tests/test_project",
		 *       "type": "commit_directory",
		 *       "links": {
		 *         "self": {
		 *           "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/test_project/"
		 *         },
		 *         "meta": {
		 *           "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/test_project/?format=meta"
		 *         }
		 *       },
		 *       "commit": { ... }
		 *     }
		 *     ```
		 *
		 *     #### Querying, filtering and sorting
		 *
		 *     Like most API endpoints, this API supports the Bitbucket
		 *     querying/filtering syntax and so you could filter a directory listing
		 *     to only include entries that match certain criteria. For instance, to
		 *     list all binary files over 1kb use the expression:
		 *
		 *     `size > 1024 and attributes = "binary"`
		 *
		 *     which after urlencoding yields the query string:
		 *
		 *     `?q=size%3E1024+and+attributes%3D%22binary%22`
		 *
		 *     To change the ordering of the response, use the `?sort` parameter:
		 *
		 *     `.../src/eefd5ef/?sort=-size`
		 *
		 *     See [filtering and sorting](/cloud/bitbucket/rest/intro/#filtering) for more
		 *     details.

		 *
		 *     The request contains multiple parts and is structured as follows.
		 *
		 *     The first part is the JSON document that describes the snippet's
		 *     properties or meta data. It either has to be the first part, or the
		 *     request's `Content-Type` header must contain the `start` parameter to
		 *     point to it.
		 *
		 *     The remaining parts are the files of which there can be zero or more.
		 *     Each file part should contain the `Content-ID` MIME header through
		 *     which the JSON meta data's `files` element addresses it. The value
		 *     should be the name of the file.
		 *
		 *     `Content-Disposition` is an optional MIME header. The header's
		 *     optional `filename` parameter can be used to specify the file name
		 *     that Bitbucket should use when writing the file to disk. When present,
		 *     `filename` takes precedence over the value of `Content-ID`.
		 *
		 *     When the JSON body omits the `files` element, the remaining parts are
		 *     not ignored. Instead, each file is added to the new snippet as if its
		 *     name was explicitly linked (the use of the `files` elements is
		 *     mandatory for some operations like deleting or renaming files).
		 *
		 *
		 *     multipart/form-data
		 *     -------------------
		 *
		 *     The use of JSON for the snippet's meta data is optional. Meta data can
		 *     also be supplied as regular form fields in a more conventional
		 *     `multipart/form-data` request:
		 *
		 *         $ curl -X POST -u credentials https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/snippets               -F title="My snippet"               -F file=@foo.txt -F file=@image.png
		 *
		 *         POST /2.0/snippets HTTP/1.1
		 *         Content-Length: 951
		 *         Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----------------------------63a4b224c59f
		 *
		 *         ------------------------------63a4b224c59f
		 *         Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="foo.txt"
		 *         Content-Type: text/plain
		 *
		 *         foo
		 *
		 *         ------------------------------63a4b224c59f
		 *         Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="image.png"
		 *         Content-Type: application/octet-stream
		 *
		 *         ?PNG
		 *
		 *         IHDR?1??I.....
		 *         ------------------------------63a4b224c59f
		 *         Content-Disposition: form-data; name="title"
		 *
		 *         My snippet
		 *         ------------------------------63a4b224c59f--
		 *
		 *     Here the meta data properties are included as flat, top-level form
		 *     fields. The file attachments use the `file` field name. To attach
		 *     multiple files, simply repeat the field.
		 *
		 *     The advantage of `multipart/form-data` over `multipart/related` is
		 *     that it can be easier to build clients.
		 *
		 *     Essentially all properties are optional, `title` and `files` included.
		 *
		 *
		 *     Sharing and Visibility
		 *     ----------------------
		 *
		 *     Snippets can be either public (visible to anyone on Bitbucket, as well
		 *     as anonymous users), or private (visible only to members of the workspace).
		 *     This is controlled through the snippet's `is_private` element:
		 *
		 *     * **is_private=false** -- everyone, including anonymous users can view
		 *       the snippet
		 *     * **is_private=true** -- only workspace members can view the snippet
		 *
		 *     To create the snippet under a workspace, just append the workspace ID
		 *     to the URL. See [`/2.0/snippets/{workspace}`](/cloud/bitbucket/rest/api-group-snippets/#api-snippets-workspace-post).

		/**
		 * Update a snippet
		 * @description Used to update a snippet. Use this to add and delete files and to
		 *     change a snippet's title.
		 *
		 *     To update a snippet, one can either PUT a full snapshot, or only the
		 *     parts that need to be changed.
		 *
		 *     The contract for PUT on this API is that properties missing from the
		 *     request remain untouched so that snippets can be efficiently
		 *     manipulated with differential payloads.
		 *
		 *     To delete a property (e.g. the title, or a file), include its name in
		 *     the request, but omit its value (use `null`).
		 *
		 *     As in Git, explicit renaming of files is not supported. Instead, to
		 *     rename a file, delete it and add it again under another name. This can
		 *     be done atomically in a single request. Rename detection is left to
		 *     the SCM.
		 *
		 *     PUT supports three different content types for both request and
		 *     response bodies:
		 *
		 *     * `application/json`
		 *     * `multipart/related`
		 *     * `multipart/form-data`
		 *
		 *     The content type used for the request body can be different than that
		 *     used for the response. Content types are specified using standard HTTP
		 *     headers.
		 *
		 *     Use the `Content-Type` and `Accept` headers to select the desired
		 *     request and response format.
		 *
		 *
		 *     application/json
		 *     ----------------
		 *
		 *     As with creation and retrieval, the content type determines what
		 *     properties can be manipulated. `application/json` does not support
		 *     file contents and is therefore limited to a snippet's meta data.
		 *
		 *     To update the title, without changing any of its files:
		 *
		 *         $ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj             -d '{"title": "Updated title"}'
		 *
		 *
		 *     To delete the title:
		 *
		 *         $ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj             -d '{"title": null}'
		 *
		 *     Not all parts of a snippet can be manipulated. The owner and creator
		 *     for instance are immutable.
		 *
		 *
		 *     multipart/related
		 *     -----------------
		 *
		 *     `multipart/related` can be used to manipulate all of a snippet's
		 *     properties. The body is identical to a POST. properties omitted from
		 *     the request are left unchanged. Since the `start` part contains JSON,
		 *     the mechanism for manipulating the snippet's meta data is identical
		 *     to `application/json` requests.
		 *
		 *     To update one of a snippet's file contents, while also changing its
		 *     title:
		 *
		 *         PUT /2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj HTTP/1.1
		 *         Content-Length: 288
		 *         Content-Type: multipart/related; start="snippet"; boundary="===============1438169132528273974=="

		 *
		 *         {

		 *           "files": {
		 *               "foo.txt": {}
		 *             }
		 *         }

		 *
		 *         --===============1438169132528273974==--
		 *
		 *     Here only the parts that are changed are included in the body. The
		 *     other files remain untouched.
		 *
		 *     Note the use of the `files` list in the JSON part. This list contains
		 *     the files that are being manipulated. This list should have
		 *     corresponding multiparts in the request that contain the new contents
		 *     of these files.
		 *
		 *     If a filename in the `files` list does not have a corresponding part,
		 *     it will be deleted from the snippet, as shown below:
		 *
		 *         PUT /2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj HTTP/1.1
		 *         Content-Length: 188
		 *         Content-Type: multipart/related; start="snippet"; boundary="===============1438169132528273974=="

		 *         }
		 *
		 *         --===============1438169132528273974==--
		 *
		 *     To simulate a rename, delete a file and add the same file under
		 *     another name:
		 *
		 *         PUT /2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj HTTP/1.1
		 *         Content-Length: 212

		 *
		 *
		 *     multipart/form-data
		 *     -----------------
		 *
		 *     Again, one can also use `multipart/form-data` to manipulate file
		 *     contents and meta data atomically.
		 *
		 *         $ curl -X PUT http://localhost:12345/2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj             -F title="My updated snippet" -F file=@foo.txt
		 *
		 *         PUT /2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj HTTP/1.1
		 *         Content-Length: 351
		 *         Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----------------------------63a4b224c59f
		 *
		 *         ------------------------------63a4b224c59f
		 *         Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="foo.txt"
		 *         Content-Type: text/plain
		 *
		 *         foo
		 *
		 *         ------------------------------63a4b224c59f
		 *         Content-Disposition: form-data; name="title"
		 *
		 *         My updated snippet
		 *         ------------------------------63a4b224c59f
		 *
		 *     To delete a file, omit its contents while including its name in the
		 *     `files` field:
		 *
		 *         $ curl -X PUT https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj -F files=image.png
		 *
		 *         PUT /2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj HTTP/1.1

		 *         ------------------------------ef8871065a86--
		 *
		 *     The explicit use of the `files` element in `multipart/related` and
		 *     `multipart/form-data` is only required when deleting files.
		 *     The default mode of operation is for file parts to be processed,
		 *     regardless of whether or not they are listed in `files`, as a
		 *     convenience to the client.
